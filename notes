Raycasting
	- render 3D environments to a 2D screen 
  - assumptions
      - all borders of the maps are closed
      - map has constant height
  - map is a 2D square grid, and each square 
    can either be 0 (=no wall), or 1(=wall)
  - for every x of the screen, send out a ray
    that starts at the player location and 
    with a direction that depends on both the player's 
    looking direction, and the x-coordinate of the screen
